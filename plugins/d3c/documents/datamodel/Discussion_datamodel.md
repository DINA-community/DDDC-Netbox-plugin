# Datamodel within Netbox

Using Netbox in industrial control systems (ICS), the [Data Model of Netbox](https://netboxlabs.com/docs/netbox/en/stable/) has to be modified by custom fields and plugins. Still, there are some major adjustments to be made for the device type in order to use it for matching the asset data base with the Common Security Advisory Framework [CSAF](https://csaf.io).

## Datamodel for OT environment

With the [asset administration shell](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/65628), there will be plenty of information about a device. However, which of those should be used for mapping vulnerabilities to a device? In the following table three documents of the IDTA are used to identify attributes for vulnerability mapping with CSAF and where this attributes can or should be find in Netbox.

### Legend

## Further Description

### Article Number - outdated

Text field is currently added to the Device Type object. Specifies the stock keeping unit (SKU).  It can be the same as model number (NetBox: part\_number), especially when seller is the vendor itself.

### Communication partner - IP

not observed communication partner IP but expected one (source of state)

### Communication partner - Protocol

not observed communication partner protocol but expected one (source of state)

### CPE

Text field added to the Device Type object. Specifies the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) string of the device type.

### Device Status

Values are a specified enumeration already present in NetBox.

### Exposure

Selection added to the Device Type object. Specifies the grade of exposure to other networks. Valid values are:

- Small:  The asset is in a highly isolated and controlled zone. There are no connections from this cyber asset‚Äôs zone to or from a zone with lower trust.
- Indirect: The asset has no direct access to a zone with lower trust, but other cyber assets in this cyber asset‚Äôs zone are accessible to or from a zone with lower trust.
- Direct: The asset is directly accessible to or from a zone with lower trust.
- Unknown: Value if category for exposure is unknown.  

### Is Router

Selection added to the Interface object. Specifies whether one of the device's interfaces is a router interface or not. Valid values are:

- Yes: Yes, if it is a router interface.
- No: No, if it is not a router interface.
- Maybe: Maybe, if it might be a router interface.
- Unknown:  Value if category is unknown.

### Manufacturer Name

Legally valid designation of the natural or judicial body which is directly responsible for the design, production, packaging
and labeling of a product in respect to its being brought into the market.\[[IDTA 02003 1 2]\](#idta-02003-1-2)

In DINA it is used in the plugin under software and as core input of the device type in Netbox.

### Safety

Boolean field added to the Device object. Specifies, if the device is used/provides safety functionality.

### Secondary Roles

Multiple objects field added to the Device object. It should be possible to assign multiple Device Roles to a device. Therefore, this custom field enables the user to designate multiple Device Roles for a device using this feature. Additionally, the existing 'Role' attribute of a device should be understood as the primary role of the device.

### Serial Number

unique combination of numbers and letters used to identify the device once it has been manufactured. [IDTA 2006](#idta-02006-2-0)

Helps to determine the affectedness. For example, a batch (SN range) has been shipped with a FW that contains a vulnerability.

### Software Name

Examples: OS like Linux or libraries in python.

### Software Type

It has to be distinguished between firmware and additional software by the flag "is firmware".

### version number

:information_source: There are plenty of valid notations for version schema. Therefore, there is no common standard.

#### version number - AAS

```text
The complete version information consisting of Major Version, Minor Version, Revision and Build Number
```

#### version-number - CSAF

CSAF provides two attributes for version information:

- product_version
- product_version_range

In the latter case, it is recommanded to use the version range specifier [vers](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/version-range-spec/VERSION-RANGE-SPEC.rst).

#### version-number - DINA

There are plenty of valid notations for version schema. Therefore, there is no common standard

### x_generic_uris

Unique name given by the vendor. The TC provides some [examples](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/649). Hardware and software, can have one or more x_generic_uri. However, an x_generic_uri can only belong to one hardware resp. software.

### Year of Construct

This information might be relevant for legacy products when mapping against new information where the product is renamed or listed under a new vendor.

## Discussion Device Type

The problem with the core field in Netbox for Device Type is that the model is unique and also the full identification for the device type. This leads to problems, when describing a device with [CSAF](https://csaf.io), since there is more than just a model (name) such as product family, product name and a stock keeping unit (sku) as illustrated with the following example:

| attribute | Netbox | DDDC |
|:---:|:----:|:---:|
| manufacturer | Rockwell Automation| Rockwell Automation|
| family | N/A | ControlLogix |
| model (number) | ControlLogix Rack K - 10 Slot| Rack K -10 Slot|
| part_number | 1756-A10K | 1756-A10K (sku)|
| | | |

In the following, some solutions for this problem is addressed

- [Enhance the deviceType describtion](#approach-1-model-name)
- [Make the deviceType recursiv](#approach-2-recursiv-devicetypes)

## Approach 1 Model Name

The model name is not important for mapping assets to CSAF documents, but to assign devices correctly in Netbox. Therefore, the proposal for the [Data model device Type #14125](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/discussions/14125) was made. It should be the sum of

- [device family](#device-family)
- [model number](#model-number)
- [part number](#part-number)
- [hardware version](#hardware-version)

### Device Family

#### device family Netbox

Not available. It is a part of the model name.

#### device family DINA

Text field added to the Device Type object. Specifies the family of a model (device type) (e.g. SIMATIC, SCALANCE) is assigned to.

### model number

#### model number Netbox

In Netbox the name convention is a little bit misleading, since under [devicetype-library](https://github.com/netbox-community/devicetype-library) a `model` is defined as :

```text
The model number of the device type. This must be unique per manufacturer.
```

So the object `model` is the model name as well as model number.

#### model number DINA

A model number can be used as an article number. However, an article number is not always/necessarily a model number. Usually, all products have model numbers, often they are listed on the sticker on the device besides the serial number

#### model number CSAF

```text
The terms "model", "model number" and "model variant" are mostly used synonymously. Often it is abbreviated as "MN", M/N" or "model no.".
```

### part number

#### Netbox part number

```text
An alternative representation of the model number (e.g. a SKU). 
```

#### part number - CSAF

CSAF defines the product identification helper [SKU](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/os/csaf-v2.0-os.html#31337-full-product-name-type---product-identification-helper---skus):

```text
Any given stock keeping unit of value type string with at least 1 character represents a full or abbreviated (partial) stock keeping unit (SKU) of the component to identify. Sometimes this is also called "item number", "article number" or "product number".
```

#### part number - DINA

It can be the same as model_number, especially when seller is the vendor itself. This can be used as an alternative presentation of the model number [e.g. SKU as in devicetype-library](https://github.com/netbox-community/devicetype-library).

### Device Description

Text field added to the Device Type object. Intended as an additional reminder alongside the device type name (e.g. CPU 414-3 PN/DP central unit with 4 MB RAM...). Could be partially part of full_product_name_t/name in a CSAF document.

### Hardware Version

Text field added to the Device Type object. Specifies the hardware version of the device type. Hardware version can be ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù if just one version was build. Multiple products exist in multiple hardware versions (due to PCB layout changes or chip shortages or hardware improvements), which can have impact on the software that can be used with the device.

## Approach 2 Recursiv DeviceTypes

There is an additional problem: manufacturers do not have a common level of the product hierarchy. This might also be the reason why level 2 is not clearly described in the IDTA.

Instead of extending the DeviceType classification, the current design of a DeviceType should remain unchanged. Only one additional field would be required:

- Is the DeviceType a child of another DeviceType?

In this way, the variable depth of manufacturers' product descriptions can be displayed.

```plaintext
Manufacturer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ product family A
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ product of family A
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ further specification
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ final specification (part number)
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ further specification
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ product family B
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ product of family B
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ further specification
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ further specification
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ final specification (part number) 
```

Always use the model name for the description of model, submodel or specification. In that way

- 1st model name describes the product family,
- 2nd model name can be used to differentiate between different products of this family,
- 3th model name can be used to differentiate between different specifications or sub products of this product.

In addition, the part number can also include the hardware version. This makes an additional custom field obsolete.
