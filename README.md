# Netbox Plugin DDDC

Even there are tools in Malcolm and [Netbox itself](https://docs.netboxlabs.com/netbox-extensions/diode-overview/) getting data into Netbox. This data should be standardized. This is done by this plugin, which contains the source code for the BSI Project 507 TP2. The DDDC plugin can receive input data from various sources, supports the processing and approval of this data in order to build a standardized device database within Netbox.\\
The main features are further developed in the repository [String-Atlas](https://github.com/DINA-community/String-Atlas). This processes the data before it is placed in the Netbox framework. This ensures that the data is adapted to support IT security management tasks such as device management, vulnerability management and patch management.

In addition to the plugin code, this repository contains additional files for the community-driven [Docker image](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker) integrating the DDDC Plugin in development mode. This is primarily used for test purposes for the CI/CD pipeline and can be used for testing the plugin within an exemplary Netbox environment.

## Installation of the DDDC Plugin

As the DDDC plugin is a standard Netbox plugin, it can be installed according to the [Netbox documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/plugins/#installing-plugins). This plugin is compatible with Netbox version 3.7.x and ensured by plugins `setup.py` file.  

Additionally, this repository contains files from the community-driven Docker image to set up Netbox, along with all its dependencies, such as a PostgreSQL database. Please note: This is not an installation for a production environment, as it uses default passwords and API keys as specified in the project's files. Furthermore, this installation sets up Netbox in 'developer mode', which means that the user will receive detailed information in case of an exception. This is very useful for alpha and beta testing, which is why this installation option is described below:

## Installation via Docker for developing and testing purposes

### Prerequisites

This Dockerfile simply extends the [netbox-docker](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker) project with the custom DDDC-plugin. Therefore, the dependencies of the netbox-docker project also apply for this installation:

Recommendation: Install docker with the Compose v2 already integrated into the Docker CLI platform.

To check the version installed on your system run `docker --version` and `docker compose version`.

After the installation, Netbox is available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
Therefore, for simplicity, a web browser should be available on the installed system.

### Installation for developing and testing purposes

1. Execute the following commands for [ubuntu 22-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04):

    ```text
    cd /home/
    apt update
    apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt-get update
    apt-cache policy docker-ce
    apt-get install docker-ce
    ```

    ```text
    git clone https://github.com/DINA-community/DDDC-Netbox-plugin.git
    cd /home/d3c/
    docker-compose build --no-cache
    docker-compose up
    ```

2. Wait until `Initialisation is done.` is printed. Afterwards the GUI can be accessed via [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
3. Login as
    - BN: admin
    - PW: admin

After testing, the containers can be stopped by pressing Ctrl+C and restarted using *docker-compose up*

### Notes regarding the installation of this plugin via the provided files

The installation will provide a warning message since the installation is using the default security token:

```text
⚠️ Warning: You have the old default admin token in your database. This token is widely known; please remove it.
```

In theory, you can add an alternative security token in the file netbox.env by adding the following line:

```python
SUPERUSER_API_TOKEN=<Token>
```

However, an important aspect of an installation in a production environment is the creation of users, tokens, and their permissions. This must be done for each Netbox installation separately and in accordance with the specific requirements in place.

### Testing

The unit tests of netbox can be executed via *./test.sh*
